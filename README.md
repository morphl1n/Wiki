## This project primarily focuses on Forms, HTTP requests, Templates, and Routes to enable easy creation, editing, and search of markdown entries. No extra CSS styling or JavaScript implementation is included, keeping the project simple.

# [Live Site](https://app-wiki.herokuapp.com/)

## Here are some of the key features of the project:

1. Access all existing entries by visiting the /Wiki page.
2. Create new entries with ease.
3. Edit existing entries to keep them up-to-date.
4. Visit a random entry page for exploration.
5. Search for entries with any substring included in their title. For example, searching for "ytho" will display the "python" entry.


## This was one of my first projects, and I'm glad you took the time to check it out
